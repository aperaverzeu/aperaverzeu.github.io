I'm Java software engineer. As a web backend developer, I specialize in Java 11/17 LTS and the Spring Ecosystem, which includes Spring MVC, Data, Security, Cloud, and WebFlux.

I have worked with Git, Docker and Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Postgres, and Apache Cassandra.
My experience covers AWS and GCP, CI/CD workflows, ELK stack, and Angular/Next.js fundamentals.
I like to read about Design Patterns and System Design.

I am interested in Project Management techniques and would like to learn more about Scrum or Agile Leadership. In addition, I like data analysis and hope to learn Scala or Python in the future. I enjoy participating in cultural events and writing science-related articles in my free time.
